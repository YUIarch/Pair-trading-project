# Project

In this project, we implemented a reinforcement learning method to tune the risk-tolerance parameter dynamically in a sequence of successive time windows, 
with the goal of maximizing the profit generated by trading cointegrated cryptocurrencies. 
The work is based on an earlier model proposed by Lintilhac and Tourin for the computation of optimal pairs trading strategies in several bitcoin markets. 
The original model was solved by using optimal stochastic control and Partial Differential Equations techniques. 
We built on this earlier work by incorporating a reinforcement learning algorithm to tune the risktolerance parameter in the model with the goal of optimizing the profit generated by trading the cointegrated cryptocurrencies. 
In particular, we used the DDPG algorithm in machine learning. 
Furthermore, the model parameters were estimated and both in-sample and out-of-sample tests were conducted for a portfolio composed of several cointegrated cryptocurrencies denominated in bitcoins. 
The transaction costs was estimated and deduced from the profit and loss. The data was downloaded from bitcoincharts.com.
